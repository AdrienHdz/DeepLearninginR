# Tutorial on Deep Learning in R: Project Overview
For the course of Avanced Statistical Learning in HEC, I created with my colleague a guided tutorial for deep learning in R. We tried as much as possible to test the latest packagez and best practices in this field.

Created a report with 30 pages called **report.pdf** organized as followed:
* Litterature review
  * FeedForward Neural Network
  * Convolutional Neural Network
  * Recurrent Neural Network
* Deep Learning Integration in R
* Methodology
  * Workflow
  * Dataset
  * Characteristic
* Available ressources
 * R packages
 * API packages
* Examples
 * Neuralnet
 * Keras
 * h20
 * MXNET
* Discussion
* Conclusion
